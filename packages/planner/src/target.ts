/**
 * Render targets described by capability, not by product name.
 *
 * The planner should not know whether it is feeding "our renderer" or "deck.gl". What
 * changes its decisions is whether compute shaders exist and whether the renderer will
 * accept a buffer the application allocated. Naming the input that way collapses what
 * looked like three separate integrations into one axis with two bits.
 *
 * The distinction that matters here is *not* deck vs not-deck. deck.gl 9.4 already ships
 * `@luma.gl/webgpu` (`webgpuAdapter`, `WebGPUDevice`) and `@luma.gl/gpgpu`, and
 * `@luma.gl/core`'s `Device` declares `createComputePipeline` and `beginComputePass`. So
 * deck under a WebGPU device has the same capabilities as our own renderer; deck under
 * WebGL2 differs only by lacking compute.
