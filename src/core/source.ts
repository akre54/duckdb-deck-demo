/**
 * The database seam.
 *
 * The library needs two things from a data layer and nothing more: the ability to run SQL
 * and get Arrow back, and a way for a relation to come into existence. Naming those as
 * interfaces is what removes `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` from the library's dependencies
 * entirely — the adapter lives behind `./duckdb`, and a consumer with their own connection,
 * their own parquet endpoint, or a MotherDuck/DuckDB-node setup can supply their own.
 *
 * It also removes the demo's synthetic generator from the runtime, which used to be
 * imported directly and made "9 clustered columns" part of the library's surface.
